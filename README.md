# RandomTest
Simple Lua program to test the results of the random() function using different seeds

In the source code, access the SEED, OUTPUT and RANGE constants to try out different results.

The mean will show you how the general values are spread out. ie: If the mean is central, it means the value are pretty much spread out from low to high.


The standard deviation will show you the range into which the majority of the value differ from the mean.
The minimum normal and maximum normal values represent that range.
